        <div style="padding-left: 10px;">Raccoons are easily recognizable mammals, with lots of fur and a number of distinguishing characteristics. If their bandit’s mask doesn’t give them away, their striped “jailbird” tail will. The area around the black markings over their eyes is white, and the rest of their body is a greyish color interspersed with lighter tan accents.
            Raccoons are active-at-night, or nocturnal, mammals that live throughout much of the world, from North and South America to Asia, in wooded areas and big cities alike.
            Raccoon Facts Overview. Raccoons are the largest of the procyonid family, which includes ringtails, cacomistles, coatis, kinkajous and other small animals with long tails.
